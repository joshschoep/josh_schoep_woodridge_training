                Hi! I'm Josh. I'm a programmer with about a year's worth of
                professional experience. I went to 
                <a href="https://www.mines.edu">Colorado School of Mines</a>
                to earn my B.S. in Computer Science before joining LGS Innovations
                (later CACI International) to do program and test development.
                I now join Woodridge Software to become a full-stack developer,
                focusing on cloud development.
            </p>

                In my personal life, I'm an avid snowboarder in the winter, and a golfer in the summer.
                I program on my own and am a member of a poker club where we play low-stakes, mostly fun
                games every week. I've been learning to cook during the quarantine, and also have been
                regularly playing video games like Phasmophobia, <abbr title="Counter Strike: Global Offensive">CS:GO</abbr>,
                and Civilization V/VI.
